#Which programming language and version did you pick?
JavaScript is the programming language I used , specifically targeting Node.js runtime v20.7.0.

#Why did you pick this programming language?
I chose this programming language because it is great for handling scripting tasks and server-side applications. With Node.js, JavaScript can be used on the server side, which makes it perfect for tasks like working with files, processing data, and managing asynchronous operations.

#How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms JavaScript offers robust support for functions/methods, unit testing, and exception handling. Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts are implemented through prototypal inheritance and the ES6 class syntax. Node.js modules facilitate file ingestion with methods for asynchronous or synchronous file read/write operations. JavaScript also features conditional statements such as if, else if, and else for executing different code blocks based on conditions. Variable assignment in JavaScript uses the = operator to assign values to variables, properties, or elements of arrays/objects.
Moreover, JavaScript supports various loop constructs including for, while, and for...of loops for iterating over arrays, objects, or other iterable collections. Functions are defined using the function keyword or arrow functions (() => {}) with the ability to accept parameters, execute code blocks, and return values. Exception handling is accomplished using try...catch blocks, enabling developers to gracefully capture and respond to unexpected runtime issues.


#List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.
fs (File System) Module, This built-in Node.js module provides methods for interacting with the file system, enabling file reading (fs.createReadStream) and asynchronous file operations. readline Module, Another Node.js module used for reading data from a readable stream (like a file stream) line by line (readline.createInterface), useful for parsing large files efficiently. lodash Library, which is a popular JavaScript utility library that provides many helpful functions for manipulating arrays, objects, and other data structures efficiently. It offers useful functions like forEach, reduce, and sortBy.
